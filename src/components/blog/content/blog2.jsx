            <p>Hungary has introduced new work permit regulations effective January 1, 2025,
                impacting foreign workers, including those from Nepal, India, and the Philippines.
                Here’s what you need to know.

                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Who Can Apply?</p>
                <p>Hungary grants work permits mainly to citizens of countries with agreements ensuring compliance with
                    immigration laws. Only select nationalities qualify for employment-based residence permits.

                </p>

            <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Eligibility for Nepali, Indian, and Filipino Citizens</p>

            <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Nepali & Indian Citizens: </p>
                <p>Not eligible under the new system, as Nepal and India are not on Hungary’s approved list.</p>
                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Filipino Citizens:</p>
                <p>The Philippines has agreements with European countries for overseas employment. Hungary has hired 
                    Filipino workers before, but 2025 eligibility depends on new agreements. Filipino applicants should 
                    check with POEA and the Hungarian embassy for updates.

                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Alternative Pathways</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Though Nepali and Indian citizens are ineligible, and Filipino applicants face restrictions, 
                        alternatives include:
                    </li>
                    <li>Employment through Recognized Organizations: International companies, multinational corporations,
                        and government-backed agencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bilateral Labor Agreements: Licensed agencies in the Philippines may facilitate employment, but Nepal
                        and India currently lack such channels.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">What Should Job Seekers Do?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor Official Updates: Check the Hungarian embassy, POEA, and government websites for 
                        policy changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Explore Other European Opportunities: Countries like Malta, Croatia, Netherlands, and Luxembourg
                        actively hire foreign workers.

                    </li>
                    <li>Seek Expert Guidance: Consult immigration professionals for alternative visa routes.</li>

                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Conclusion</p>
                <p>Hungary’s 2025 work permit rules make it difficult for Nepali and Indian citizens to apply, while 
                    Filipino applicants have limited options. Staying informed and considering other European job markets 
                    is advisable.
