            <p>Croatia has made new rules for work permits due to many people misusing the system. This affects 
                workers from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the Philippines, especially those applying 
                from GCC countries.

                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">What Happened</p>
                <p>Many workers got work permits but never came to Croatia.
                    Some used their Croatian visa to enter other Schengen countries instead.
                    Example: In 2023, 12,400 Bangladeshis got work permits, but 8,000 never arrived.
                    Similar issues were found with Nepali, Indian, Filipino, and Egyptian workers.

                <p className="font-semibold text-lg">What is Changing</p>
                <p>Tighter Rules: Croatia stopped or reduced giving new work permits for Bangladesh until the issue is solved.</p>
                <p>Stricter Checks: Applicants from Nepal, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines will face stronger background checks and more delays.
